## 1- Time Series: Smoothing

Smoothing is a technique applied to time series to remove the fine-grained variation between time steps. The hope of smoothing is to remove noise and better expose the signal of the underlying causal processes.


## 2- Time Series: AutoRegression Modelling

In statistics, econometrics and signal processing, an autoregressive (AR) model is a representation of a type of random process; as such, it is used to describe certain time-varying processes in nature, economics, etc. The autoregressive model specifies that the output variable depends linearly on its own previous values and on a stochastic term (an imperfectly predictable term); thus the model is in the form of a stochastic difference equation (or recurrence relation which should not be confused with differential equation). Together with the moving-average (MA) model, it is a special case and key component of the more general autoregressiveâ€“moving-average (ARMA) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models of time series, which have a more complicated stochastic structure; it is also a special case of the vector autoregressive model (VAR), which consists of a system of more than one interlocking stochastic difference equation in more than one evolving random variable.


## 3- An Application: Stock Prediction

One of the most widely used models for predicting linear time series data is this one. The ARIMA model has been widely utilized in banking and economics since it is recognized to be reliable, efficient, and capable of predicting short-term share market movements.
